## 3. About me: ##
Now i work an engineer. in the modern world, the IT sphere is coming to the fore. Therefore, getting a profession related to IT becomes, if not necessary, then very desirable for a successful career. The way to this is self-education and constant work. I like to learn something new. I hope this will help me in successfully mastering the JavaScript/Front-end course.
As Pierre Boist said:
